1. price
2. income

## Law of Demand
1. The amount demanded increases with the fall in price and diminishes with a rise in price other thing remaining the same.
2. inverse relationship with price/indirect relation ship/negative relationship

## unit 2 (Elasticity of Demand and supply)
=> The elacticity of demand is responsiveness of demand for a commodity to the change in any of it's determinants. (price is the major factor influencing demand,therefore elacticity of demand refers to the price elacticity of demand).

> Types of Elasticity of Demand
- cross eleacity of demand
- price eleacity of demand
- income eleacity of demand

## 1.price eleacity of demand
=> Price elasticity of demand is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a goods or service to a chane in it's price.

> Derivation formula
``` javascript
   price eleacity of demand(Ep)= %change in quantity demanded / % change in it's price

   = ΔQ/Q * 100% / Δp/p * 100%
    // whare Q and P is the initial quantity of price
    // ΔQ and Δp is the change in price and quantity
              or
     ΔQ/Δp *  p/q     // where p and q are the initial quantity and price..
```
> Types of price eleacity of demand
1. Perfectly Elastic Demand(Ep=∞)
=>  if a negligable change in price leads to infinite change in quantity demanded, it is called perfectely elactic demand.
2. perfectly Inelastic Demand(Ep=0)
=> if there is no change in quantity demanded with a change in it's price,it is called perfectely inelastic demand.
3. Relatively Elastic Demand (Ep>1)
=> When percentage change in quantity demanded is more than percentage change in it's price,it is called Relatively Elastic demand.
4. Relatively Inelastic Demand(Ep<1)
=> When percentage change in quantity demanded is less then percentage chage in it's price,it is called Relatively inelastic demand.
5. Unitary Elastic Demand(Ep=1)
=>When percentage  change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in it's price, it is called Unitary Elactic Demand.

> Question. What are the uses of price Elasticity of demand in business decsion making.?
1. Price determination
2. Wage determination
3. international Trade
4. importance in preparation of budget

> Measurement of price Elasticity of Demad by Point Method.

=> It is used to measure price elasticity of demand at a point in demand curve.

>formula
``` javascript

Ep=Lower segment of the demand curve/ upper segment of the demand Curve

```

## 2. Income Elasticity of Demand
=> Income elasticity of demand is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a goods or service to a change in the income of consumer.

> Derivation formula
``` javascript
   income eleacity of demand(Ey)= %change in quantity demanded / % change in income of the consumer

   = ΔQ/Q * 100% / Δy/y * 100%
    // whare Q and y is the initial
    // ΔQ and Δy is the change in income and quantity
              or
     ΔQ/Δy *  y/q    // where p and q are the initial quantity and income..
```
> Types of Income Elasticity of Demand
1. Positive income Elasticity(EY>0)
- Income elasticity Greater than unity (Ey>1)
- Income elasticity less than unity (Ey<1)
- Income elasticity equal than unity (Ey>1)

=> If quantity demanded increase with increase in income level of consumer and vice versa,it is called Positive income elasticity. 

2. Negative Income elasticity(Ey<0)
=> If quantity demanded increase with decrease in income level of consumer and vice versa,it is called negative income elasticity. (example. futpat )

3. Zero income Elasticity(Ey=0)
=> The quantity demanded is same if income level of consumer is increase or decrease.
